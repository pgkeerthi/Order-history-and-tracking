# Order-history-and-tracking  
How It Works!!!

-> It works using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the interface and handle logic.

-> All the order data is saved in the browser's local storage, so it stays even after refreshing.

-> When we add or search an order, JavaScript updates and displays it instantly on the page.
