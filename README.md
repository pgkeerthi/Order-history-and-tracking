# Order-history-and-tracking
How It Works!!!
It works using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the interface and handle logic.

All the order data is saved in the browser's local storage, so it stays even after refreshing.

When we add or search an order, JavaScript updates and displays it instantly on the page.
